Neighborhood: 
Department of Finance assessors determine the neighborhood name in the course of valuing properties.  The  common  name  of  the  neighborhood  is  generally  the  same  as  the  name  Finance designates. However, there may be slight differences in neighborhood boundary lines and some sub-neighborhoods may not be included.

Building Class Category: 
This  is  a  field  that  we  are  including  so  that  users  of  the  Rolling  Sales  Files  can  easily  identify  similar  properties  by  broad  usage  (e.g.  One  Family  Homes)  without  looking  up  individual  Building  Classes.  Files  are  sorted  by  Borough,  Neighborhood,  Building  Class  Category, Block and Lot.

Tax Class at Present: 
Every  property  in  the  city  is  assigned  to  one  of  four  tax  classes  (Classes  1,  2,  3,  and  4),  based on the use of the property.  • Class  1:  Includes  most  residential  property  of  up  to  three  units  (such  as  one-,  two-,  and  three-family  homes  and  small  stores  or  offices  with  one  or  two  attached  apartments),  vacant  land  that  is  zoned  for  residential  use,  and  most  condominiums that are not more than three stories.  
• Class  2:  Includes  all  other  property  that  is  primarily  residential,  such  as  cooperatives and condominiums.  
• Class 3: Includes property with equipment owned by a gas, telephone or electric company.  
• Class  4:  Includes  all  other  properties  not  included  in  class  1,2,  and  3,  such  as  offices, factories, warehouses, garage buildings, etc.

Block: 
A Tax Block is a sub-division of the borough on which real properties are located. The  Department  of  Finance  uses  a  Borough-Block-Lot  classification  to  label  all  real  property  in  the  City.  “Whereas”  addresses  describe  the  street  location  of  a  property,  the  block  and  lot  distinguishes  one  unit  of  real  property  from  another,  such  as  the  different  condominiums  in  a  single  building.  Also,  block  and  lots  are  not  subject  to  name  changes  based on which side of the parcel the building puts its entrance on.

Lot:   
A Tax Lot is a subdivision of a Tax Block and represents the property unique location.

Easement:    
An easement is a right, such as a right of way, which allows an entity to make limited use of another’s real property.For example:  MTA railroad tracks that run across a portion of another property.

Building Class at Present: 
The Building Classification is used to describe a property’s constructive use. The first position of  the  Building  Class  is  a  letter  that  is  used  to  describe  a  general  class  of  properties  (for  example   “A”   signifies   one-family   homes,   “O”   signifies   office   buildings.   “R”   signifies   condominiums).  The  second  position,  a  number,  adds  more  specific  information  about  the  property’s  use  or  construction  style  (using  our  previous  examples  “A0”  is  a  Cape  Cod  style  one family home, “O4” is a tower type office building and “R5” is a commercial condominium unit). The term Building Class used by the Department of Finance is interchangeable with the term Building Code used by the Department of Buildings. See NYC Building Classifications.
